# Learn to read music

I'm learning to play the piano. 

It's taking me some time to learn to read music. So, I decided to build a python script to help me with this.
Later this repo evolved into a separate quiz to practice playing various things.

I wrote most of this pretty smashed, so if you stumble across this then please don't judge me on my hacky coding style.
