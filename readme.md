# Learn to read music

I'm learning to play the piano. 

It's taking me some time to learn to read music. So, I decided to build a python script to help me with this.

I wrote most of this pretty smashed, so if you stumble across this then please don't judge me on my hacky coding style.

```python quiz.py```
